# Scheduler Sequence Diagrams

This document contains extracted sequence diagrams from **sched-diag.pdf**.

## 1. Plan New Assignment

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant AS as "Assignment Service"
    participant SCH as "Scheduler Service"
    participant DB as "PostgreSQL"
    participant SV as "Schedule Versions"

    AS->>DB: INSERT "Assignment"
    AS->>DB: SELECT "Existing tasks for student"
    AS->>SCH: plan(assign, constraints, existingTasks)
    SCH->>SCH: computeSlots() + splitIntoBlocks() + resolveConflicts()
    SCH-->>AS: TaskDiff {created[], warnings[]}
    AS->>DB: INSERT TaskDiff.created as "Task[]"
    AS->>SV: INSERT "ScheduleVersion" {cause:"create", diff:TaskDiff}
    AS-->>AS: Return {assignment, tasks, scheduleVersionId, warnings}
```

## 2. Replan on Update

```mermaid

    autonumber
    participant AS as "Assignment Service"
    participant SCH as "Scheduler Service"
    participant DB as "PostgreSQL"
    participant SV as "Schedule Versions"

    AS->>DB: SELECT "Assignment + completed vs future tasks"
    AS->>AS: remaining = new_est - actual_logged
    AS->>DB: SELECT "Other tasks that may conflict"
    AS->>SCH: replanRemaining(remaining, constraints, futureTasks, otherTasks)
    SCH->>SCH: minimizeChanges() + honorCaps() + resolveConflicts()
    SCH-->>AS: TaskDiff {moved[], resized[], created[], deleted[], warnings[]}
    AS->>DB: APPLY TaskDiff to "Task" table (future tasks only)
    AS->>DB: UPDATE "Assignment" (new due/estimate, version++)
    AS->>SV: INSERT "ScheduleVersion" {cause:"update", diff:TaskDiff}
    AS-->>AS: Return {updatedAssignment, updatedTasks, scheduleVersionId, warnings}
```

## 3. Adapt on Overrun (Execution Feedback â†’ Heal Plan)

```mermaid

    autonumber
    participant TS as "Telemetry / Timer"
    participant AS as "Assignment Service"
    participant SCH as "Scheduler Service"
    participant DB as "PostgreSQL"
    participant SV as "Schedule Versions"

    TS->>DB: INSERT "WorkSession" for task
    TS->>AS: notifyOverrun(taskId, actual > planned)
    AS->>DB: SELECT "Task + nearby tasks and caps"
    AS->>SCH: adapt(strategy, taskContext, constraints)
    SCH->>SCH: choose(extend_now | add_follow_up | shift_others)
    SCH-->>AS: TaskDiff {resized[] | created[] | moved[], warnings[]}
    AS->>DB: APPLY TaskDiff to "Task" table (future tasks only)
    AS->>SV: INSERT "ScheduleVersion" {cause:"slip", diff:TaskDiff}
    AS-->>TS: ack with updated plan summary
```
